				<h3> <b>Acknowledgement </b></h3>
				<p>The Treasury  of Truth  has, as  its most  prominent  core  feature  a series  of 423 specially  commissioned  illustrations,  at the rate  of one  per stanza  in The Dhammapada. This  veritable  gallery  of  Dhammapada  illustrations  is  the  creation  of artist  P.  Wickramanayaka,  a  well-known  Sri  Lankan  professional.  He  was  assisted  by artist  K.  Wijayakeerthi.  The  illustrations  bear  witness  to  the  wisdom  encapsulated  in  the Chinese proverb,
                <br>  'ONE  PICTURE  IS WORTH  TEN  THOUSAND  WORDS'. 
                <br>
                Together,  all  these  elements  make  it a  unique  work,  that  will  ensure  the  enlightened Dhammapada  -  understanding  not only of the contemporary  world,  but also  of generations to  come.  The  over-riding  and  consistent  measure  of this  noble  publishing  endeavour  has invariably  been  the  quality  and  quantum  of understanding  it will  engender  in the  reader. Each segment of the work is calculated  to bring about an escalation  of the reader's  awareness of what  the Buddha  said.  In effect,  the total  work  strives  to approach  as  close  as  is possible to the concept  the Buddha  originally  communicated  through  these  timeless  stanzas.

                            But after observation  and analysis, when you  find that anything  agrees  with  reason 
                            and is conducive  to the good and benefit of one  and all then  accept it and live up to it.

						<p>         TO WIN  PEACE 
                            <br>
                            The question  that inevitably  suggests itself is, how far can  the great message 
                            of the Buddha  apply to the present-day world?  Perhaps  it may  apply,  perhaps  it 
                            may not;  but if we  follow  the principles enunciated  by the Buddha,  we  will 
                            ultimately  win peace  and tranquility  for the world.
