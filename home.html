				<h3> <b>Dedication </b></h3>
				<p>
					In a world,  largely  bewildered and rendered  very  much helpless  by Man's  seemingly unceasing  unkindness  to Man, 
					the well-springs  of love,  compassion and affection  have  begun  to dry up  into  a weak trickle in almost  every  theatre  of human  existence. This  unprecedented  anthology  of the Buddha's  Word,  in text  and copious illustration  is dedicated  to humanity, with  the unswerving  aim  of guiding  its destiny  towards an  Era of Peace,  Harmony  and wholesome  Co-existence.

						<h3>"The Gift of Dhamma surpasses all other Gifts"</h3>
						<p>
						In  the  religious  literature  of the  world  that  pre-eminently  represents man's  continued  urge  towards  the spiritual,  <b>The  Dhammapada</b>  occupies  a  place  of highest  distinction.  Its  sacred  contents  have  unceasingly influenced  human thought,  holding aloft the torch of knowledge to light the path of men  in their quest for truth and inner solace.  In the current global  context,  The  Dhammapada  has  evolved  into  the  stature  of an outstanding  treasure  of the  common  human  heritage,  transcending man-made  borders' and  boundaries  and  rising  above  limitations  imposed  by time.  The Dhammapada,  in  short,  is among  the  handful  of gems  of sacred  literature  esteemed  by people  all  over  the  globe,  irrespective  of cleavages  of creed,  faith  and  variegated  religious 	professions. 
					
						<b>The Dhammapada,</b>  under the title <i>'The Treasury  of Truth'</i>  is to take the words of the <b>Buddha</b> further  afield,  in a verbal  and visual idiom  that will  have  greater  appeal  to the  modern  mind.  The  eternal  wisdom  embodied  in the  verses  of The  Dhammapada  holds  within  it the  potential  to bring  tranquility  to  men and women  troubled  by the stresses  and conflicts  of life as it is being lived by a good majority of the people  in today's world  of disharmony  and  distress.  In spite  of the deeply  felt need  of the contemporary  world,  to yearn  for peace,  solace  and tranquility,  the words  of the <b>Buddha</b> has  not  generally  been  presented  in a  frequency  that  throbs  to the  rhythm  of the  modern mind-set. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The  rationale is to bring The  Dhammapada  closer  to generations  who  are  being  brought  up  right  round  the  globe  on a staple  fare  of visual messages  emanating  in multiple  colour,  from  the world's  visual  -  primary  media  -  both  of electronic  and print categories. 
					
						The Eternal  Truth  revealed  by the Exalted  Buddha,  could  be summed  up under  the  four  headings:  Dukkha  (unsatisfactoriness),  its  cause,  the cessation  of Dukkha  and  the  way  thereto.  The  Exalted  Buddha  expounded  the  Doctrine  of  these  four  Great  Truths,  illustrating  and communicating  it to suit  the  mentality  of his  hearers  of wide  ranging backgrounds.  All his teachings  have been grouped into three collections -  or  <b>Three  Baskets  (Tipitakas) </b>.  <i>The  three  Pitakas  are  Vinaya,  Abhidhamma  and Sutta.</i>  The  present  work  Dhammapada  is the second  book of the Minor  Collection  (Khuddakagama)  of the Sutta  Pitaka  (The Basket  of Discourses).  It consists  of 423  stanzas  arranged  in 26 Vaggas  or  Chapters. By reading  Dhammapada,  one  could  learn  the  fundamentals  of the  Buddhist  way  of life.  It leads  its reader  not  only to a happy  and useful  life here  and hereafter  but also  to the achievement  of life's  purpose  “Summum  Bonum”  the  Goal  Supreme.

						<h4> <b>Man  who  achieved  a Great  Victory</b> </h4>
						<p>One  of the first scholars  to begin  the work of translating  the Pali Literature into  English,  was  the son  of a well-known  English clergyman.  His object in undertaking  the work was  to prove  the superiority  of Christianity  over Buddhism.  He failed in this task, but he achieved  a greater  victory  than he expected.  <b>He became  a Buddhist.</b>  We must never  forget the happy chance which  prompted him  to undertake  this work and thereby  make  the precious <b>Dhamma</b>  available  to thousands  in the West.  The name  of this great scholar  was <b>Dr.  Rhys Davids.</b>

						<h4> <b>A Radiant  Sun</b> </h4>
						<p>
						In this world of storm  and strife,  hatred and violence,  the message  of the <b>Buddha</b> shines  like a radiant sun.  Perhaps  at no time  was  that message  more  needed than  in the world of the atomic  and hydrogen  bombs.  Two  thousand five hundred years  have  only added to the vitality  and truth  of that message.  Let us remember  that immortal  message and try to fashion  our  thoughts  and actions in the light of that teaching.  We may face with  equanimity  even  the terrors  of the atomic  bomb  age and help a little  in promoting  right thinking  and right actions.
